# Learn Data Science Through Sports

Journey through the world of data science from beginner to advanced concepts and methodologies. In this repository, I will walk you through DS skills, hints, tips, and tricks all with Sports relevant examples! 

I will provide walkthroughs, notebooks, and code snippets weekly using some of my favorite examples from the sports world. We will go over concepts such as Python fundamentals, SQL fundamentals, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Data Mining, Algorithm development, automation, machine learning, AI, and more!

# Before we Begin 

The following curriculum is hosted in a Jupyter notebook environment. If you are not familiar with this platform/do not have it installed, follow this link:
https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/

All of my notebooks in the curriculum are .ipynb files (Jupyter notebook files). Once you have this environment set up, you can easily follow along with the entire curriculum!


# The Curriculum

### Congrats on completing the Rookie Section! 

By now, you can tell how Python can be a great foundational tool in your Sports Data Science journey. The next portion of the curriculum is going to be very "learn by example" based. I feel that this is not only an engaging way to learn, but I feel like this is the best way to get the creative juices flowing! 

I will be introducing new concepts, modules, and methodologies in the following examples without specifically dedicating a learning section to them. With repetition and "doing", these concepts will naturally stick! You will also begin to develop an analytical mindset and become familiar with some very common data science processes and workflows. I will also include a list of skills you will learn under each project name!

# Novice Section (Let's begin on some real life projects)

## Novice Project 1 (MLB Databank from 1871-2015)

Skills Used: Ingesting Datasets from Kaggle, Reading csv files into Dataframes, Exploring Dataframes, .loc and .iloc (accessing Dataframe elements), extracting data from specific columns, merging tables, intro to cleaning data, and creating visuals to show key insights!
