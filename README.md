# Learn Data Science Through Sports

Journey through the world of data science from beginner to advanced concepts and methodologies. In this repository, I will walk you through DS skills, hints, tips, and tricks all with Sports relevant examples! 

I will provide walkthroughs, notebooks, and code snippets weekly using some of my favorite examples from the sports world. We will go over concepts such as Python fundamentals, SQL fundamentals, Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Data Mining, Algorithm development, automation, machine learning, AI, and more!
